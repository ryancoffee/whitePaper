ABSTRACT = {Dedicated simulations show that the application of time-domain ptychography to angular photo-electron streaking data allows shot-to-shot reconstruction of individual X-ray free electron laser pulses. Specifically, in this study, we use an extended ptychographic iterative engine to retrieve both the unknown X-ray pulse and the unknown streak field. We evaluate the quality of reconstruction versus spectral resolution, signal-to-noise and sampling size of the spectrogram.},

ABSTRACT = {Utilisation of partially coherent X-rays in Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CDI) and X-ray ptychography have brought intense research and developments for the past few years. Generally, data reconstructions convergence can be achieved by considering to incorporate partially coherent X-rays in ptychographic iterative reconstructions algorithms. Recently, exploration of both X-ray probe and sample modes have been studied and it was suggested that sufficient constraints are required to achieve accurate data reconstructions due to the mathematical inseparability of multiple sample modes that are superimposed into a single set of ptychographic intensity patterns. Here we review the multi-modal ptychography that can be used as a new emerging technique to investigate dynamical sample systems with partially coherent X-rays by recent experimental and simulated demonstrations.},

ABSTRACT = {For the investigation of processes happening on the time scale of the motion of bound electrons, well-controlled X-ray pulses with durations in the few-femtosecond and even sub-femtosecond range are a necessary prerequisite. Novel free-electron lasers sources provide these ultrashort, high-brightness X-ray pulses, but their unique aspects open up concomitant challenges for their characterization on a suitable time scale. In this review paper we describe progress and results of recent work on ultrafast pulse characterization at soft and hard X-ray free-electron lasers. We report on different approaches to laser-assisted time-domain measurements, with specific focus on single-shot characterization of ultrashort X-ray pulses from self-amplified spontaneous emission-based and seeded free-electron lasers. The method relying on the sideband measurement of X-ray electron ionization in the presence of a dressing optical laser field is described first. When the X-ray pulse duration is shorter than half the oscillation period of the streaking field, few-femtosecond characterization becomes feasible via linear streaking spectroscopy. Finally, using terahertz fields alleviates the issue of arrival time jitter between streaking laser and X-ray pulse, but compromises the achievable temporal resolution. Possible solutions to these remaining challenges for single-shot, full time–energy characterization of X-ray free-electron laser pulses are proposed in the outlook at the end of the review.},

	abstract={The time-energy information of ultrashort X-ray free-electron laser pulses generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source is measured with attosecond resolution via angular streaking of neon 1s photoelectrons. The X-ray pulses promote electrons from the neon core level into an ionization continuum, where they are dressed with the electric field of a circularly polarized infrared laser. This induces characteristic modulations of the resulting photoelectron energy and angular distribution. From these modulations we recover the single-shot attosecond intensity structure and chirp of arbitrary X-ray pulses based on self-amplified spontaneous emission, which have eluded direct measurement so far. We characterize individual attosecond pulses, including their instantaneous frequency, and identify double pulses with well-defined delays and spectral properties, thus paving the way for X-ray pump/X-ray probe attosecond free-electron laser science.},
